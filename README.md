## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a data scientist dedicated to developing explainable AI models that prioritize transparency, interpretability, and trust in machine learning systems. This repository is a space where I share projects, experiments, and tools that aim to make AI decisions more understandable and accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.

As AI becomes more integrated into decision-making processes across industries, ensuring that models are not just accurate but also explainable has become essential. My focus is on bridging the gap between complex models and human understandingâ€”using techniques that reveal how predictions are made, what features matter, and how models behave under different conditions.

I work with both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning models, incorporating libraries such as SHAP, LIME, Captum, and Skater to generate model insights. I also explore interpretable-by-design approaches, including rule-based models and inherently transparent algorithms, as alternatives to black-box systems.

This repository features projects that cover a range of real-world applicationsâ€”from healthcare and finance to customer behavior analysisâ€”where explainability is a key requirement. Each project includes well-documented code, visualization tools, and narratives that walk through how insights are derived from the models.

Iâ€™m also exploring ethical AI principles, bias detection, and fairness metrics, recognizing that transparency is just one piece of responsible AI development.

If youâ€™re interested in interpretable machine learning, model transparency, or the broader field of responsible AI, feel free to explore the projects, share feedback, or start a conversation. Collaboration and open discussion are essential in pushing the boundaries of what explainable AI can achieve.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building AI that people can truly understand and trust.
